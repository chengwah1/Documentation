**THIRM** is a protocol that allows users to access cryptocurrency assets between multiple blockchains. 

## Abstract

With the rise of DEFI many dApps are being built on blockchains, but these blockchains run on different codebase which makes using the Apps from blockchain A impossible on blockchain B. While many dApps are being ported accross blockchains, they are limited and might not function the same way as intended on the main blockchain.

Some blockchians don't support dApps at all (Bitcoin and Litecoin are good examples).

So what if a Bitcoin user wants to use a DEX (decentralized exchange) on Ethereum? How will he use these dApp? He needs a service that will allow him to use his Bitcoin on any other blockchain.

Here comes THIRM, a Crosschain Bridge that allows many blockchains to connect each other.
