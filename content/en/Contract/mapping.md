Since THIRM Solvers are atomic, there is no need for local database, instead, superior smart contracts can be and are used like in this instance. THIRM used smart contract to store various mapping to map all the needed data.

This helps solve the following problems: 

1. **Data Integrity** - Since all the data are mapped one by one, it ensures that data is not lost and is accurate and consistent.

2. **Abstraction** - Keeps Solvers from taking direct input which prevents 100% hacking attempts or DDOS attacks.

3. **Trustless** - makes the whole environment trustless, everything is on blockchain and can be verified with ease across the blockchain.
